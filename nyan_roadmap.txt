- PB7: backup i2c - I2C1 SDA (alternate function)
- PB8 - PB13: printer data 1 - 6 (output)
- PB14: motor direction (output)
- PB15: automatic latch (output)

SPI1:
- transfers data to led driver (MAX6966)
- data transmission gets triggered by DMA1 channel 3 (checks if SPI1 transmit buffer is empty)
- DMA1 is only activated in main loop, whenever new led data is ready to be sent

DMA1 Channel 2:
- provides image data for printer on 6 parallel data lines
- transmission is triggered by TIM1, which generates the serial clock for the printer
- direction: memory -> peripheral
- source: image buffer
- destination: Port B ODR (output data register)
- width: byte -> half word (only complete ODR can be written, so low byte of port b must all be on alternatve function or data is mirrored there as well)
- data length: size of image buffer, 64 bytes per line
- circular mode

DMA1 Channel 3:
- sends led data to SPI1
- triggered by SPI1_TX (transmit buffer empty)
- normally disabled, only activated in main loop when new led data is available (or maybe just continously)
- direction: memory -> peripheral
- source: led buffer
- destination: SPI1 DR (data register)
- width: half word -> half word
- length: 9x 16 bit (9 transmissions)
- non-circular mode

TIM1:
- generates clock for serial data transmission to printer -> TIM1_CH1 output to parallel clock pin
- frequency: 72 MHz (system frequency)
- period: 71 (generates 1 MHz clock)
- channel 1 compare value: 35 (50 % duty cycle)
- channel 1 maps to DMA1
- one-pulse mode (64 repetitions, results in one image line)
- after 64 repetitions: Interrupt that triggers latch (update interrupt)

TIM2:
- generates step signal for motor -> TIM2_CH1 output to stop pin
- frequency: 1 MHz -> could be adjusted "on the fly" to change pitch
- period: either fixed to 1000 or adjusted to change pitch
- channel 1 compare value: 50 % duty cycle
- PWM mode: 2 ("high - low")
- update interrupt: activates TIM1 to transfer new data or TIM3 for strobe impulse (switch between the two every other update)
- plan for later: turned on or off by TIM4 to control tone length

TIM3:
- generates strobe impulse -> TIM3_CH1 output to strobe pin
- startet inside ISR of TIM2 update event
- frequency: 1 MHz
- period: 750 (for 750 us strobe length, depends on voltage and paper)
- channel 1 compare: 1 (so the output stays off when timer is reset, but goes high immediately after starting the timer)
- PWM mode: 1 ("low - high")
- one-pulse mode -> fires once and shuts itself down after that

TIM4:
- might control TIM2 later
- by doing so, it controls the tone length and givs an interrupt when the next note is needed
- however, for now the note length and pitch will be monitored in the main loop

USART1:
- asynchronous mode
- for debugging or daisy chaining multiple printers
